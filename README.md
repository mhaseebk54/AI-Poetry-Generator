# 📝 AI Poetry Generator (Using Free Open-Source LLM)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **AI Poetry Generator** that creates poems and creative text based on user prompts using a **free and open-source Large Language Model (LLM)**.

The implementation is provided in a **Jupyter Notebook**, making it easy to understand, modify, and experiment with. The project runs locally on **CPU only** and does not rely on any paid APIs, making it suitable for **academic assignments and learning purposes**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Build a Generative AI–based system that:

* Accepts a user prompt
* Generates poetry or creative text
* Uses a free open-source LLM
* Runs locally without paid APIs
* Demonstrates basic text generation using NLP

---

## 🧠 Model Used

* **Model Type:** Open-source Language Model
* **Framework:** Hugging Face Transformers
* **Pipeline Used:** `text-generation`
* **Execution:** CPU only

The model generates poetry based on prompt input and predefined generation parameters.

---

## 📂 Input / Dataset

* No external dataset required
* User provides text prompts directly

### Example Prompts

* Write a poem about artificial intelligence
* Create a short poem on nature
* Generate a motivational poem

---

## ⚙️ Features

* Prompt-based poetry generation
* Uses open-source LLM via Hugging Face
* Simple and beginner-friendly implementation
* Runs fully offline after model download
* Easy to customize generation parameters

---

## 🛠️ Installation

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Run `AIPoetryChatbot.ipynb`
4. Enter a prompt to generate poetry

## 🧪 Example

**Prompt:**

```
Write a short poem about AI
```

**Generated Output:**

```
In circuits deep where thoughts ignite,
A mind of code learns day and night...
```
